# Software Changes

* Now creates a family tree data file for each person's immediate family tree. Basically, it outputs the data for the subject, their siblings and spouse(s), their parents and their children into a JSON file.
* Gender spouses. Previously the page just said "spouse", it now attempts to gender that to say "husband" or "wife" if married, but just says "partner" if there is no marriage event recorded. If a divorce event is recorded then it changes to "ex-husband" or "ex-wife".

# Site Changes

* The family tree data file mentioned above is rendered into a family tree chart, which is at the bottom of each person's page.
