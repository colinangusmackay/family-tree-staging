* Added a blog
* Added an RSS feed for the blog
* Added quick links to the blog and indexes in the page header
* The rendering of block quotes (e.g. in the sources, or footnotes) has improved line spacing.
* Fixed bug where some links were not being rendered correctly and thus taking the user to a 404 (Not Found) page.
