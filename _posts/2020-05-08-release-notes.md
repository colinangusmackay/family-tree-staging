## Software changes

The software to generate the site now redacts source information when it is referenced by people who are potentially alive. Only the metadata is displayed now. This may result in some information being redacted when the person the source is about is associated with another person who lacks a birth/death date, as the software can't determine whether they are alive or not, so assumed that they may possibly be alive.
