> 1. William Andrew Campbell, who married Grace McTurk in 1918, registered in Applegarth.
>

> The birth record for Rachel Smith Campbell will be release in Jan 2021 which should detail the parents' names and the marriage location which should help narrow this down if no other information presents itself before then.
