### 3

> Rona Grigg's book suggest birth about 1816, but letter from John MacLennan notes that George Mackay was 87 when he died in 1893, putting the date of birth:
>
> Between 26 NOV 1805 and 25 Nov 1806. However, the same letter contradicts itself in the next paragraph by noting that George Mackay was 40 on the birth of his daughter in 1855, which puts his DoB as being between 6 Nov 1814 and 5 Nov 1815.
>


### 4

> The chart in EMBO has a precise date, but it does not appear to be corroborated with the register (as noted by the "(c)" placed next to certain dates). So, accepting the date given by the Registrar in Brora (in the 1984 letter to B.M. Tulloch).
>


### 5

> EMBO/P113 suggests DoB of about 1843
>
> Letter to B.M.Tulloch says married at 30 on 7/Nov/1876 so birth is between 8/Nov/1845 and 9/Nov/1846
>


### 6

> EMBO/P113/F9.2.4 says birth about 1844
>
> Letter to B.M.Tulloch says married at 28 on 23/Oct/1877, so puts birth at 1848/9
>


### 7

> Two differing suggestions
>
> <br/>
>
> EMBO says 1854
>
> Letter to B.M.Tulloch says 19 years back from marriage in 1869 which would put birth between 17/Nov/1849 and 16/Nov/1850
>


### 8

> Conflicting dates of birth.
>
> EMBO suggests 1849
>
> Letter to B.M.Tulloch suggests between 22/Oct/1855 to 21/Oct/1856 (Marriage at 17 on 21/Oct/1873)

> There are some conflicts between sources on the date of birth. Going with the most precise, which is also from a registrar - so assuming also the most accurate.
