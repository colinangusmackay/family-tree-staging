> Eileen McIver became a Member of the Order in 1991, and through her loyal contribution to the care and maintenance of the Priory Library in St John’s House in Edinburgh, she was eventually promoted to Commander in 1999.
>
> <br/>
>
> She attended the Chancery Library on a daily basis and brought the book card index to its current high standard. She also kept a close check on those precious historical volumes which were sent out to specialist book binders for repair and maintenance.
>
> <br/>
>
> Eileen was the ideal Consoeur to look after the precious volumes because in her professional career she had been the Librarian at Napier University in Edinburgh. She took a keen interest in matters historical and was also a life-long member of the Heraldry Society of Scotland, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.

> Sadly she became a victim of Alzheimers and spent her latter years in the Blenham House Nursing Home where she passed away on October 15 2015, aged 95.
>
> <br/>
>
> Fortunately in the management and catalogue of our Priory Library Eileen has left her own memorial to remind us of a devoted contributor to the Priory of the Order of St John in Scotland.
