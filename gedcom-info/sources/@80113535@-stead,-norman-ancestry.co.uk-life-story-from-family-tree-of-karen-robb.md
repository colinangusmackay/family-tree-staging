## Notes

> This is a mutable source and information in it may change.
>
> <br/>
>
> At this time, I can't find any birth documentation that supports a birthdate of September 1939. A Norman Stead was born in Dewsbury in Q4 1937 to someone née Fawley.
>
> <br/>
>
> This story is missing the divorce between Margaret O'Malley and Norman Stead. Margaret remarried in 1969.
