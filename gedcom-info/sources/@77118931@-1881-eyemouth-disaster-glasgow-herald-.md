> The arrival of the gunboat Ariel at North Shields without having seen anything of the missing boats confirms the very worst fears entertained from the first. The unsuccessful search of the Ariel was shared in by the John Berwick tug, which had done out from Berwick on a second cruise in quest of the missing vessels. She touched at Sunderland this afternoon, and about five o'clock a telegram was received at Eyemouth from the fishery office at North Sunderland stating that the master of the tug reported that no trace of the remainder of the fishing fleet had been discovered. The message from fishermen who went out as guides with the gun boat asked if there were any fresh news at Eyemouth, and whether the Ariel should continue its cruise and if so in what direction.
