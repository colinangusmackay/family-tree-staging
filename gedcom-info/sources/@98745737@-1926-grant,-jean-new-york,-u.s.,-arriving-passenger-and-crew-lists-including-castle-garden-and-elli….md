## Notes

> In the entry for "Whether going to join a relative or friend, and if so, what relative or friend, and his name and complete address" the word "Brother" is typed, but there is handwriting over the top that is illegible. Given than "Mr John Fraser" is not a brother of Jean Grant, I assume it is a correction.
