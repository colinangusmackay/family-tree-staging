I emigrated to the United States of America from Glasgow, Scotland on the vessle Numidia; my last foriegn residence was said Emles. It is my bona fide intention to renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, and particularly to George V, King of Great Britain and Ireland, of which I am now a subject; I arrived at the port of Boston in the State of Massachussets on or about 9th day of November, anno Domini 1909; I am not an anarchist; I am not a polygamist not a believer in the practice of polygamy; and it is my intention in good faith to become a citizen of the United States of America and to permanently reside therein: SO HELP ME GOD
