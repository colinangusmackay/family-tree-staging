> Cutting from the Northern Times with three photographs related to Embo lent to the paper by Morag Macdonald, daughter of Janet Grant Cumming. The first shows the Embo drifter Mizpah sailing into Wick Harbour. It has the caption 277 WK MIZPAH at the top. The boat was owned by Donald Cumming, father of James Cumming, whose widow was still living at Mizpah, Front Street, Embo at the time of the article (date unknown).

> Thanks to our readers, we are able from time to time to take a peek into the apst with old photographs found in cupboards, or in some cases cherished for years in special hideaways.

> This is a sample of some we have borrowed this year, showing the life of our people spanning more than 50 years from the beginning of this century. Note how styles and modes have changed, though faces remain full of character and interest.

> The picture on the left is of the Embo-owned sailing drifter _Mizpah_ coming into Wick harbour, according to the orignal caption. The vessle was owned by Donald Cumming, father of James Cumming, whose widow still resides in the family home "Mizpah", 9 Front Street, Embo

>
> - James Cumming's wife was a widow in the article
>
> - James Cumming died in the summer of 1975
